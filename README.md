# Job Market Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard that visualizes key insights and trends within the job market. The dashboard currently highlights insights for **Intern** positions, specifically for **Software QA Tester** roles that prefer a **B.Tech** qualification.

## Project Overview

This dashboard is a filtered view of a larger job market dataset. Its primary purpose is to help job seekers and recruiters understand the landscape for specific roles by answering questions like:

-   What is the typical salary range for a Software QA Tester intern?
-   Where are these intern opportunities located geographically?
-   Which companies are hiring for these roles?
-   What are the common qualifications and skills required?
## Live Project

The Tableau dashboard is deployed and can be viewed directly at the following URL:

[**Job Analytics Portal**](https://job-analytics-portal-liard.vercel.app/)

## Current Filtered View

The dashboard currently displays data based on the following selections:

-   **Role:** Software QA Tester
-   **Work Type:** Intern
-   **Qualifications:** B.Tech
-   **Preference:** Female

The data can be easily adjusted using the filters on the right side of the dashboard to explore different roles, locations, or qualifications.

## How to Interact with the Dashboard

To view and use this dashboard, you will need to open the Tableau Workbook file (`.twb`).

1.  Download the **`Job_Analytics_Portal.twb`** file and the **`job_descriptions.xlsx`** data file from this repository.
2.  Ensure both files are in the same folder.
3.  Open the `.twb` file using either **Tableau Desktop** or the free **[Tableau Reader](https://www.tableau.com/products/reader)** application. The dashboard will automatically connect to the Excel data file.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains two essential files:

-   `Job_Analytics_Portal.twb`: The **Tableau Workbook** file. This is the main dashboard file that contains all the visualizations.
-   `job_descriptions.xlsx`: The **Excel data file** that serves as the data source for the Tableau dashboard. This file contains the raw job description data.

## Data Source
